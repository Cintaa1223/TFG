**TFG: Citizen Science Projects Recommendation System Based On The Spanish Elementary School Curriculum**

Citizen Science (CS) is a field of research that allows citizens to engage in scientific projects. In the field of education, this type of science offers students practical and real-life opportunities to learn, as well as increase their interest in scientific research.

The goal of this project is to provide teachers with a tool to find citizen science projects that can be used in classrooms to help students achieve the key competences stated in Catalan elementary school curriculum. For this, various algorithms will be developed where information extraction techniques are applied to extract information about citizen science projects in order to create a recommender system that provides teachers with the best suited projects based on the key competences or any key words of their choice, and a web application to let users interact with the recommender system.

From an educational perspective, it is expected that by integrating information about CS projects in a formal education setting, teachers get inspired to create learning activities.
