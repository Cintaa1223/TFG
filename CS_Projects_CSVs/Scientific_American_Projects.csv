This is a place where wildlife, people, and livestock have co-existed for thousands of years. It’s also where you'll find the ""towers of the savanna,"" reticulated giraffes. They are one of Africa's most popular animals, and yet they are still little studied and not well understood. There is much to learn about these giraffes, but before we have even begun to delve into their mysteries, they are being threatened. It is now clear that they need conservation efforts to keep them from becoming extinct.One thing we do know, unfortunately, is that giraffes are in trouble. Across Africa, all giraffe populations have declined by about 40 percent, leading the IUCN Red List in December 2016 to officially list giraffes as “Vulnerable” to extinction. Our project focuses on the reticulated giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata), and current estimates show that the population of these giraffes has declined by over 70 percent in the past 20 years—from 36,000 to less than 9,000 today. The main drivers behind the decline appear to be habitat loss and fragmentation, land degradation and poaching.Wildwatch Kenya seeks to count, identify and track the giraffes in conservation field sites, along with the other animals that share the habitat, to better understand the behavior, movements, and population numbers of the wildlife found here. Citizen scientists are being called to help researchers look through the tens of thousands of photos taken by trail cameras placed in strategic spots throughout the sites. The information gathered from these photos will help us and the local communities develop plans to help save these magnificent animals.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

With each piece of plastic taking over 400 years to degrade, our oceans, all marine life, and even our own health and livelihoods are in real danger of drowning. Despite this and the 8 million tons of plastics entering our ocean each year, researchers can account for only one percent of that ends up: our ocean surface. Where is the missing 99 percent?The answer can be found on the seafloor, in marine life, and on our coastlines. The Zooniverse Plastic Tide citizen science project harnesses drone imagery from a series of beaches and the power of computer programs, or machine learning algorithms for the more technically minded, to eventually create a program that can autodetect, measure and monitor the levels of plastics and marine litter washing up on our beaches. Eventually helping us to track where plastics and litter go in our oceans, revealing where the missing 99 percent is in our ocean goes.By tagging plastics and litter in the images we take with our drone, citizen scientists directly teach our computer program to autodetect, measure and monitor plastics to help researchers answer how much of the missing 99 percent ends up on our beaches.

Clinical classification (histologic) of endometriosis doesn't correlate to patients’ experience of the disease, a gap the researchers aim to bridge through the citizen science project. They have two dual goals of capturing individual's experience of the disease for self management and then drawing together data from many individuals to describe the disease using data science techniques.More specifically, the researchers seek to phenotype endometriosis. A phenotype simply means a set of observable characteristics. In endometriosis, this can be the symptoms that we experience as patients such as endo belly, shooting leg pain, or exhaustion; biomarkers for the disease; or histology from tissue samples (like what you see on a pathology report after a laparoscopy). The Phendo app was built using Apple’s ResearchKit framework. The Phendo app is differentiated from other ResearchKit apps by capturing variables of a disease that is not well understood and for which phenotypes are still unclear.Citizen Endo is a project created by women with endometriosis, who happen to be data scientists and health researchers at Columbia University in New York.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

Although several drugs and a partially effective vaccine have been developed to help combat TB, the TB bacterium can evolve to resist available medicine, particularly when patients interrupt or discontinue treatment. Nearly half of European cases are now resistant to at least one drug, and 4 percent of all cases worldwide are resistant to treatment regimens that combine drugs. HIV patients with weakened immune systems are approximately 30 times more likely to contract TB.The tuberculosis bacterium has a coating that shields it from many drugs and the patient's immune system. Among the fats, sugars and proteins in this coat are fatty molecules called mycolic acids. The Help Stop TB project will use the surplus computing power donated by IBM's World Community Grid members to simulate the behavior and chemical properties of mycolic acids to better understand how they protect the TB bacteria. Scientists hope to use the results to eventually develop better treatments for this deadly disease, particularly those that evade TB cell wall defenses.Citizen scientists can help researchers by signing their computer up for IBM's World Community Grid to become part of a crowdsourced, virtual supercomputer that performs millions of computations. These computationswill model aspects of tuberculosis bacteria behavior to better understand its potential vulnerabilities that new medicines may one day exploit. Volunteers make the processing power on their devices available when otherwise not being used—say, between keystrokes, during a coffee break, or overnight—to perform the calculations necessary for these simulations. Volunteers download an app from IBM's World Community Grid to their PC or Mac; it recognizes when the machine isn't being used and then it gets to work crunching numbers, automatically stopping when the machine is needed for normal use. It's safe, unobtrusive and puts otherwise wasted electric power to good use. Crowdsourcing a virtual supercomputer provides faster results than relying on conventional computational resources typically available to researchers.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

Recurring life cycle events (or phenology) of plants, such as yearly flowering, seed dispersal, and leaf shedding are key to understand plant functioning.Long-term observations of tropical trees are rare. The Jungle Rhythms observations comprise three decades of data on the central African tropical forest, and are therefore an extraordinary source of information on the life cycles of tropical trees. All of these weekly observations were jotted down in little notebooks and finally summarized in large hand-drawn tables. Jungle Rhythms will transcribe the summary tables in an effort to recover the key parts of this knowledge, which currently only exists on paper, and preserve the original copy.The nature of the notation used, mainly using fine hand-drawn pencil lines overlaying another fine gray line, make it really hard to process these images automatically.

When first scanned, the pages of digitized books and journals are merely image files, making the pages unsearchable and virtually unusable. While OCR converts page images to searchable, machine encoded text, historic literature is difficult for OCR to accurately render because of its tendency to have varying fonts, typesetting and layouts.This educational game enables citizen scientists to engage in “purposeful gaming” by playing Smorball, which asks players to correctly type the words they see on the screen—punctuation and all. Smorball presents players with phrases from scanned pages from cultural heritage institutions. After much verification, the words players type are sent to the libraries that store the corresponding pages, allowing those pages to be searched and data mined and ultimately making historic literature more usable for institutions, scholars, educators and the public.Dartmouth College’s Tiltfactor, an interdisciplinary studio that designs and studies games for social impact, developed Smorball. Smorball is part of the “Purposeful Gaming and BHL Project,” which explores how digital games can make scanned content more accessible and searchable for cultural institutions.

However, with approximately 58 percent of the world’s 335 turtle species threatened with extinction, turtles are the most endangered vertebrate group in the world. For that reason the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., invites citizen scientists to help turtles with the launch of the Connecticut Turtle Atlas project.Connecticut is home to 12 native turtle species that inhabit the state’s woodlands, wetlands, and even the waters of Long Island Sound. Primary threats include habitat loss and traffic-related highway mortality. The Bruce Museum would like to assist in educating the public about turtles and their benefits to the ecology as well as provide actions citizen scientists can take to help them.The Connecticut Turtle Atlas project runs from April through November and will continue on an annual basis. Participants willcollect data on specific locations and abundance of all turtle species found throughout the state. These volunteer scientists will gather the data through the Web and a smartphone app. This information will be used to map distributions, identify important habitats, locate areas of nesting abundance, and detect roadways with high traffic-related mortality.

Most of the known asteroids orbit in the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids (the name means “starlike bodies”) can be as small as a few meters across, or as large as an asteroid like Ceres, almost 1,000 km in diameter (or about 1/12 of Earth). They vary in color from darker than charcoal to the color of freshly broken rock. Typically, asteroid orbits are more inclined (tipped) and more eccentric than any of the planets.		The study of the asteroids helps us understand how planets and the basis for life form and evolve. Since no significant geological processes have taken place on these small bodies, the asteroids preserve a history of the Solar System in a way that the planets do not. These minor bodies contain relics of the conditions of the early Solar System.		Scientists also like to keep tabs on near-Earth asteroids. In 1994, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 slammed into Jupiter, leaving scars larger than the earth on the giant planet. We have evidence of other impacts on our planet, even within the last 100 years.

Do you know what happens to our coasts after these extreme storms? The U.S. Geological Survey has launched a new crowdsourcing application called “iCoast – Did the Coast Change?” to show you these coastal changes from extreme storms.		Since 1995, the USGS has collected more than 140,000 aerial photographs of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts after 24 hurricanes and other extreme storms. For Hurricane Sandy alone, more than 9,000 aerial photographs were taken a week after the storm. iCoast allows citizen scientists to identify changes to the coast by comparing these aerial photographs taken before and after storms.		Crowdsourced data from iCoast will help USGS improve predictive models of coastal change and educate the public about the vulnerability of coastal communities to extreme storms. Currently, USGS’s mathematical models are derived from dune elevation and predicted wave action during storms. Adding the human observations will allow the scientists to validate the models and to provide better predictions of damage before storms occur.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

Duran wants citizen scientists to help him figure out if and why this might be true and how we can help them move back into areas they once lived.	The Elderberry Longhorn Beetle is easy to spot with its bold patterns of blue and gold and long antennae. It's so attractive, in fact, that it was chosen for a USPS stamp design in 1999, according to Duran. The best way to find one of these beetles is to first find elderberry plants. Although Elderberry Longhorn Beetles will fly around and land on a variety of plants, they are usually not far from the elderberry plants that they need to complete their life cycle.	Elderberry (Sambucus) is typically shrub-sized, but it may get as large as a small tree. It has white flowers arranged in loose clumps or “sprays” and leaves that form clusters of 5-7 smaller leaflets.	“I can't promise you'll find one, but if you keep an eye out, you might have a chance at seeing one of these impressive creatures,” Duran says. “They come out at different times in different places, but June is often a good time to see them.”*Correction (05/27/14): This sentence was edited after posting.

Although Woods Hole doesn’t expect levels to be dangerously high in the ocean or in seafood as the plume spreads across the Pacific, this is an evolving situation that demands careful, consistent monitoring to make sure predictions are true.	Fundraising—Citizen scientists wishing to propose a sampling location near them must raise the cost of testing and shipping ($550 to $600 depending on location). Woods Hole will then send a sampling kit with everything needed. The institution will also help by setting up a fundraising Web page that citizen scientists can e-mail to friends or post on favorite social media site. This will allow citizen scientists to spread the word and track their progress.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

To do this we need to estimate the ages of star clusters and then study how many clusters there are at each age. Along the way we will also learn more about the host galaxy itself, particularly how star clusters form along its spiral arms.		In Project Star Date M83, citizen scientists will pair their discerning eye with the Hubble telescope’s detailed images to identify the ages of the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy’s (M83) many star clusters.

Computer algorithms have already scanned the images, but there are likely to be many more space warps that the algorithms have missed. Space Warps’ creators think that it's only with human help that all of them will be found.Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, predicted that massive objects, such as stars, would bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths. Evidence for this theory was first obtained by Arthur Eddington in 1919, when during a solar eclipse he observed that stars near the edge of the Sun appeared to be slightly out of position.Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also provide useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. The separation and distortion of the lensed images can tell astronomers how much mass there is in the object, and how it is arranged. It’s one of the few ways of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is, how “clumpy” it is and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies. Knowing this can provide crucial information about how galaxies evolve.Gravitational lenses help astronomers answer all kinds of questions, including how many very low mass stars–that aren’t bright enough to detect directly–are lurking in distant galaxies.

These species prefer habitats in an early stage of succession such as young forests, shrublands, and old orchards and fields. As New York's forests grow older, these preferred habitats are declining, resulting in a decline in grouse and woodcock numbers since the 1960s. Turkey hunters in pursuit of that wary gobbler this spring are ideally suited for monitoring ruffed grouse during the breeding season.The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) currently monitors grouse populations in the fall through the Cooperator Ruffed Grouse Hunting Log where hunters record the number of birds flushed per hour of hunting effort.

The goal is to use citizen-science classifications to create software that researchers worldwide can use to extract information from bat recordings, making it really easy to track bat populations. This will make understanding how bat populations are being effected by global change much easier.Bat Detective begins its journey in Europe and, over the course of the project will release data from more areas from around the world. In Europe, there are more than 40 species of bats, and all use echolocation to eat insects. Most species hibernate to escape the food shortage in insects during the winter. Others migrate to other parts of Europe during winter, but very little is known about which species do this. In the summer, most species split into separate female and male roosts (in buildings, tree cavities, under bridges, caves), where the males just chill out whilst the females busily gather insects to raise their baby. During the autumn the males and females come back together again to mate and then don’t emerge again until the next spring.Many believe that monitoring the status of bat populations can help tell us about the health of a natural environment as a whole; the bats serve as an early warning, like a canary in a coal mine. This is because bat species are distributed all over the world, and provide lots of services to humans through controlling pests by eating vast quantities of insects and pollinating and dispersing commercially important crops (for example bananas, tequila).Bat Detective is a partnership project between University College London, Zoological Society of London, The Bat Conservation Trust, BatLife Europe, University of Auckland, and the Citizen Science Alliance.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

Citizen scientists play the game by arranging nucleotides. The goal of the game is to maximize the matches and minimize the mismatches between the DNA sequences on the digital game board.A sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA or protein to identify regions of similarity. These similarities may be consequences of functional, structural or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. From such an alignment, biologists may infer shared evolutionary origins, identify functionally important sites, and illustrate mutation events. More importantly, biologists can trace the source of certain genetic diseases.Traditionally, multiple sequence alignment algorithms use computationally complex heuristics—trial-and-error efforts—to align the sequences. This approach requires a lot of computing power given the sheer size of the genome, which consists of roughly three billion base pairs. Humans are good at recognizing patterns and solving visual problems efficiently, so adding citizen scientists to the equation is expected to optimize alignments in ways that the computer algorithm can't.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

The project has since expanded so that citizen scientists can also plant Bee balm, Cosmos, Rosemary, Tickseed, and Purple coneflower for the purposes of this research.Some bee populations have had severe declines, and this may be affecting food production. There have been few efforts to measure how much pollination is happening over any given region so it is unclear how these declines in bees influence gardens. As the researchers point out, many plants can't set fruit until they have been visited by a bee. The Great Sunflower project uses observational bee data collected by citizen scientists to create a nationwide (and hopefully worldwide) online map of bee populations.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Entomology Department has created a citizen science project to likewise study declining bee populations called BeeSpotter, although this project is limited for the time being to the state of Illinois.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

Each citizen scientist must then pass a Web-based test to qualify to register and participate. After passing the test and registering, the participant can login to the virtual microscope program, which automatically connects to Berkeley's server and downloads images for perusal.

If at least two of the four volunteers viewing each image report a potential particle, that image is fed to 100 more volunteers for verification. If at least 20 of these report a potential particle, UC Berkeley undergraduates who are expert at spotting dust grain tracks will confirm the identification. Eventually, the grain will be extracted for analysis. Discoverers will get to name their dust grains.

In addition to the particles collected during Stardust's encounter with comet Wild 2 in January of 2004 the spacecraft delivered tiny particles of interstellar dust that originated in distant stars, light-years away. Scientists estimate that Stardust collected 45 of these micron-sized interstellar dust particles using an aerogel collector 1,000 square centimeters in size.Finding the individual dust particles, however, has been a challenge—made worse by the condition of the collector plates, which are interspersed with flaws, cracks and an uneven surface. Through its Stardust@home citizen science project, University of California, Berkeley, researchers have invited Internet users to help them search for these few dozen submicroscopic grains of interstellar dust captured by NASA's Stardust spacecraft. The researchers took scans of the plates from a cleanroom at Houston's Johnson Space Center and made images of these scans available for public viewing via the Web. The dust grains will have made carrot-shaped trails in the aerogel, which is a silicon-based sponge 100 times lighter than water.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/

Beespotter is a Web-based partnership between the professional science community and citizen scientists—starting in Illinois exclusively but with the goal of spreading nationwide—to meet a critical need for data collection and to provide opportunities for the public to learn more about these ecologically essential organisms.Species in the family Apidae—honey bees and bumble bees—are ideal subjects for citizen-scientist contributions to experimentation and data collection. Because of their striking coloration and readily recognizable shape and behavior, as well as their relatively large size (at least as far as insects are concerned), honey bees and bumble bees are far more easily ""spotted,"" photographed, and identified based on color pattern than most of the other 3,500+ species of bees in North America. There is currently no systematic nationwide effort to document pollinator status in North America beyond the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) annual survey of honey bees used for honey production. The goals of Beespotter are to engage citizen scientists in data collection to establish a baseline for monitoring population declines, to increase public awareness of pollinator diversity, and enhance public appreciation of pollination as an ecosystem service. The use of photography for identification, instead of the net, pin, and spreading board of traditional entomology, is consistent with the goal of preserving bee diversity and enhancing pollinator appreciation.",Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/
